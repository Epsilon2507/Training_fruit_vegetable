Data Preparation:

Generated dummy datasets for training and validation using NumPy.
Converted these datasets into tf.data.Dataset for more efficient data handling.
Model Architecture:

Designed a simple CNN model using Keras Sequential API.
Added layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation and a sigmoid output layer.
Compilation:

Compiled the model with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
Set up accuracy as the evaluation metric.
Training:

Trained the model using both NumPy arrays and tf.data.Dataset objects.
Monitored the training process over 32 epochs to ensure proper learning and validation.




TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning projects. Whether using NumPy arrays or tf.data.Dataset, TensorFlow offers robust tools for building and training sophisticated models.

Looking forward to applying these skills to more complex datasets and models! If you have any questions or insights, feel free to reach out.
